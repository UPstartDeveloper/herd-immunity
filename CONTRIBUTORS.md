- **About Me**: I am a software engineer and data scientist. I am passionate about making an impact on others' minds, and I built this project originally as part of a class at Make School.
Feature: initial work on the front end design using Bootstrap 4, using MongoDB to store users' favorite Tweets, and integrating the Twitter API.

- **Fun Fact**: My mother is a psychiatrist, and used to keep all her old books from med school in the house. If you can imagine it, I was allowed to read those books - typically reserved for people at least in their early twenties - when I was just nine years old! My favorite book from those days was *Clinician's Guide to Mind over Mood* (2001), by by Dennis Greenberger and Christine A. Padesky!
