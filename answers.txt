Answers:
1. Our inputs were as follows:
population size: 1000
percentage vaccinated: 5%
Virus name: Polio
Mortality rate: 22%
Reproduction Rate: 59%
Initial infected: 5

2. The percentage of the population that became infected before the
virus burned out was 95%.

3. 20.5% of the population died during the simulation.

4. The number of interactions where vaccinations saved individuals
from dying was 745. The initial vaccination percentage was 5%, meaning that 50
people in our population were vaccinated at the beginning of the simulation.
The total amount of vaccinated people at the end was 795. Assuming that each newly
vaccinated person resulted from only one interaction, that means it took 745 interactions
for our simulation to save the additional 745 people from dying.
